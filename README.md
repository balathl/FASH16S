# FASH16S
Software development for metagenomics NGS analysis
###Title: FASH16S - Fast automated analysis shell based running pipeline for 16S rRNA amplicon NGS data stored in secured windows network drive 
###Introduction
###Next generation sequencing revolutionized the science with the possibility to do massively parallel sequencing of the whole microbiome in many sample altogether. This opens a great possibility to investigate the entire microbial profile rather than just testing few ones in the samples. Also, culture-independent approach in this methods is another advantage to its crown. The genotype or sequence based approach is more useful than the assay or phenotype approach to investigate many questions and also to formulate some questions as well for further research.  In addition, the cost of NGS sequencing is getting low and low which make it feasible to apply and get NGS data. However, this also brings the challenges of how we deal with million and million of sequences and 100s of projects.  The computational analysis by bioinformaticians using various programs helps analyze the data. But over the time, the demand gets increased and many people needs to analyse the data. So, There is a need for the  software tool which can perform automatically the analysis steps and present the results is essential to deal with this situation. FASHRUN16S was developed to achieve this.  
###The main objective of this tool is to automate the 16S NGS data analysis and can be used by biologist or non-programmers around the world who uses similar data analysis. 
###Some of the problems addressed by FASHRUN16S pipeline includes
###(1) automation of running 16S ngs analysis with multiple steps as single tool useful to quickly check the sequences upon arrival
###(2) Confidential data within certain  network can be mounted using CIFS on any Linux workstation or server securely using FASHRUN16S and can be analysed within that network
###(3) Data management organisation integrated in the pipeline which saves time in the present and future of the analysis
###(4) Transperancy and reproducibility is possible in github(www.github.com/FASH16S) 
###(5) R codes executed by R CMD BATCH can perform the data analysis schema included in the pipeline so that the report can be generated with statistics and visualizations
